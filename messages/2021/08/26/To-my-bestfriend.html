  <h1>To My Bestfriend</h1>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>And that’s because I wanna be your favorite boy 
 I wanna be the one that makes your day
 The one you think about as you lie awake<br />
 I can’t wait to be your number one <br />
 I’ll be your biggest fan and you’ll be mine <br />
 But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>To my bestfriend</em> ….</p>

<p>I dunno where are you know, and maybe even I show that I don’t care, I do. It’s just tough for me to accept that we’re not that thing anymore, you were the only person I felt I could speak comfortably about everything, but now you’re gone.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like the sorrow and pain, the mark you left was a scar. A scar deep enough to make me remember it every time I meet a new person, something I wish never happen again.</p>

<p>I still remember the night we spent together, the memories, the long conversations when we talked about our past. The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It’s the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.</p>

<p>Why I’m talking online in a weird blog post? 
People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that’s bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they’re afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But they’re wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It’s all in how you carry it. That’s what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, you’re letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain.</p>

<p>If you read this, you should know that I love you, I’m truly love you, but you keep playing, dumb bitch :”D</p>
